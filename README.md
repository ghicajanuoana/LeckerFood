I created my first Android application.
This is a simple android app, using Firebase for database data and for authentification.
I called this app "LECKER FOOD" 
I wanted to create a friendly interface from where you can order food.
This is the first page. Here you can sign up to create an account, or log in if you don't have already an account.

The authentification works. 
After log in, this is the main page of the app.

Here you can search for the food you want, click on the food you want to order and then you can click on the cart to finalize the shopping.
